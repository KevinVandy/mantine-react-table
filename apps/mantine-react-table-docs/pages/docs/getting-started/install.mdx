</Head>

## Installation

If you are using **Mantine V5.7+**, but not **v6** yet, you will want to install mantine-react-table `v0.9.5`.

If you are using **Mantine V6**, you will want to install the MRT `v1.0.0` betas.

> The last version of MRT that supports Mantine V5 is mantine-react-table `v0.9.5`.

> `mantine-react-table` V1 requires **Mantine V6.0+** packages as dependencies in your project.
>
> If you are already using Mantine, you probably already have most of these peer dependencies installed.
>
> Just double-check that you have the following in your package.json, or use the [full install commands](<#install-with-required-peer-dependencies-(recommended)>) below.
>
> 1.  `@mantine/core` (v6.0+)
> 2.  `@mantine/hooks` (v6.0+)
> 3.  `@mantine/dates` (v6.0+)
> 4.  `@tabler/icons-react` (v2)
> 5.  `@emotion/react` (v11)
> 6.  `dayjs` (v1.11+)
> 7.  `react` and `react-dom` (v17 or v18)

### Quick Install

NPM

```bash
npm install mantine-react-table@beta
```

PNPM

```bash
pnpm add mantine-react-table@beta
```

Yarn

```bash
yarn add mantine-react-table@beta
```

### Install With Required Peer Dependencies (Recommended)

NPM

```bash
npm install mantine-react-table@beta @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/dates @emotion/react @tabler/icons-react dayjs
```

PNPM

```bash
pnpm add mantine-react-table@beta @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/dates @emotion/react @tabler/icons-react dayjs
```

Yarn

```bash
yarn add mantine-react-table@beta @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/dates @emotion/react @tabler/icons-react dayjs
```

> You do NOT need to install `@tanstack/react-table`, as it is already an internal dependency of `mantine-react-table`, and must use an exact version already specified internally.
>
> All internal dependencies: `@tanstack/match-sorter-utils`, `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, and `highlight-words`

### Common Errors

If you get an error like this:

```bash
"Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in,
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

You probably do not have the correct version of Mantine installed. Make sure all mantine packages are at least v5.7.0.

If you are using an older version of `webpack` or `create-react-app` and get an error like this:

```bash
./node_modules/@tanstack/virtual-core/build/lib/index.esm.js 147:92
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (147:92)
File was processed with these loaders:
```

Then try upgrading either `webpack` or `react-scripts` to the latest versions.
