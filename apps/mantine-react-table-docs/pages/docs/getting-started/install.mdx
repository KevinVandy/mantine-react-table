> This is the install guide for `mantine-react-table` **V1** and `@mantine/` packages **V6**. MRT V1 will not work with Mantine V7. MRT V2 will be released by the end of 2023 and will work with Mantine V7.

## Installation

> `mantine-react-table` V1 requires **Mantine V6.0+** packages as dependencies in your project.
>
> If you are already using Mantine, you probably already have most of these peer dependencies installed.
>
> Just double-check that you have the following in your package.json, or use the [full install commands](<#install-with-required-peer-dependencies-(recommended)>) below.
>
> 1.  `@mantine/core` (^v6.0)
> 2.  `@mantine/hooks` (^v6.0)
> 3.  `@mantine/dates` (^v6.0)
> 4.  `@tabler/icons-react` (2.23.0+)
> 5.  `@emotion/react` (v11)
> 6.  `dayjs` (v1.11+)
> 7.  `react` and `react-dom` (v18)

### Quick Install

<InstallCommand packagesString="mantine-react-table" />

### Install With Required Peer Dependencies (Recommended)

<InstallCommand />

> You do NOT need to install `@tanstack/react-table`, as it is already an internal dependency of `mantine-react-table`, and must use an exact version already specified internally.
>
> All internal dependencies: `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, and `@tanstack/match-sorter-utils`

### Common Errors

If you don't see any styles applied to the mantine table components, you may have mismatching versions of `mantine-react-table` and `@mantine/core`. MRT v1 requires Mantine v6 and will not work with Mantine v7. MRT v2 will be released by the end of 2023 and will work with Mantine v7.

If you get an error like this:

```bsh
"Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in,
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

You probably do not have the correct version of Mantine or Tabler Icons installed.

Make sure all mantine packages are at least v6.

Make sure that the `@tabler/icons-react` package is at least v2.23.0.

If you are using an older version of `webpack` or `create-react-app` and get an error like this:

```bsh
./node_modules/@tanstack/virtual-core/build/lib/index.esm.js 147:92
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (147:92)
File was processed with these loaders:
```

Then try upgrading either `webpack` or `react-scripts` to the latest versions.
