## Installation

> `mantine-react-table` V1 requires **Mantine V6.0+** packages as dependencies in your project.
>
> If you are already using Mantine, you probably already have most of these peer dependencies installed.
>
> Just double-check that you have the following in your package.json, or use the [full install commands](<#install-with-required-peer-dependencies-(recommended)>) below.
>
> 1.  `@mantine/core` (v6.0+)
> 2.  `@mantine/hooks` (v6.0+)
> 3.  `@mantine/dates` (v6.0+)
> 4.  `@tabler/icons-react` (2.23.0+)
> 5.  `@emotion/react` (v11)
> 6.  `dayjs` (v1.11+)
> 7.  `react` and `react-dom` (v18)

### Quick Install

<InstallCommand packagesString="mantine-react-table" />

### Install With Required Peer Dependencies (Recommended)

<InstallCommand />

> You do NOT need to install `@tanstack/react-table`, as it is already an internal dependency of `mantine-react-table`, and must use an exact version already specified internally.
>
> All internal dependencies: `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, and `@tanstack/match-sorter-utils`

### Common Errors

If you get an error like this:

```bsh
"Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in,
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

You probably do not have the correct version of Mantine or Tabler Icons installed.

Make sure all mantine packages are at least v6.

Make sure that the `@tabler/icons-react` package is at least v2.23.0.

If you are using an older version of `webpack` or `create-react-app` and get an error like this:

```bsh
./node_modules/@tanstack/virtual-core/build/lib/index.esm.js 147:92
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (147:92)
File was processed with these loaders:
```

Then try upgrading either `webpack` or `react-scripts` to the latest versions.

If you are using the Next.js App Directory and get an error like this:

```bsh
Attempted import error: 'useState' is not exported from 'react'
```

Mantine itself does not work with React Server components and will require `"use-client"` on all components from both Mantine and MRT. The creator of Mantine recommends not using Mantine in the Next.js App Directory at all. Mantine V7 and MRT V2 should address this issue by the end of 2023.
