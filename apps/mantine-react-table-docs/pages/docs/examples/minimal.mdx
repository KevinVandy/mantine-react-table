## Minimal Example

Mantine React Table gives you a lot out of the box, but it's also easy to turn off any features that you do not need.

Every feature has an `enable...` prop that let's you turn it on or off.

Also, you can choose to not import the entire `<MantineReactTable />` component and instead import a smaller sub-component like `<MRT_TableContainer />` or `<MRT_Table />`. These imports do not include all of the extra toolbar components and only include the React code for the table itself.
