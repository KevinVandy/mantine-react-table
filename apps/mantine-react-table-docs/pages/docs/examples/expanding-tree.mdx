## Expanding Tree Example

Mantine React Table supports showing rows in a expanding tree structure. This example is the ***simplest*** implementation of this feature where each row of data potentially has a special `subRows` property that contains an array of sub rows. You don't have to follow this exact structure, but this is how MRT will expect to find your sub rows by default.

Learn more about how to customize this in the [expanding sub-rows feature guide](/docs/guides/expanding-sub-rows).
